# FutureX - A SwiftUI-based financial App

## introduction 
Over the past several years, technology, finance, and social impact have converged to create new
avenues of space for some of humanity's knottiest problems. The Pay-for-Success model marries private
investment with public sector priorities as a method of financing social programs. The creation of FuturX
builds mobile technology to capture this model.
